### Steps Taken into Consideration

I have used # Google Bigquery # as my source and all data stored in it. I used DBT to connect to Google Bigquery and performed the following transformations in DBT.
1. Cleaning of data.2. Create a Fact and Dimension table using theÂ Start schema.3. Connected big query to PowerBI and created a data modeling diagram and created 2 sample visualizations using powerbi.
